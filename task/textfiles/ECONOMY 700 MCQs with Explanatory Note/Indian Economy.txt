1.      (b)   The  concept  of  mixed  economy  evolved  from  the  ideas  of  
Keynes.  The
concept of mixed economy means that both private enterprises and public
enterprises  coexist.  However,  the  condition  attached  is  that  the  
private
enterprises must work for serving the society rather than having only self
interest. Further the private enterprises may not be allowed in every sector
of the economy like area of national importance.

There are 3 types of economics system:-

a.     CDpiWDOiVP - the private ownership of the means of production (capital) 
and a
market economy for co-ordination. As-corporate capitalism

b.     Mi[ed (conoPy ([DPpOe - American school, Japanese system, Nordi model,

Social corporatism etc

c.     SociDOiVP - In this economic system, two coordinating mechanism 
(planning and
market) subdended into planned socialist and market socialist system.

2.      (b)   India  is  a  labour-surplus  economy  because  in  India  there  
is  disguised
unemployment along with under-employment which means that qualified,
skilled  workforce  willing  to  work  is  available  but  there  are  not  
enough
employment opportunities.

economy.

CDpiWDO  SXUpOXV  -  It  is  equity  which  cannot  otherwise  be  classified  
as
capital stock or retained earnings.

3.      (d)   The Indian Economy is characterised by pre-dominance of 
agriculture, low
per  capita  income  and  massive  unemployment.  In  India  contribution  of
agriculture to GDP is around 17.9%.

4.      (d)   Private income arising in a country does not include current 
payments on
foreign  loans.  Private  income  includes  any  type  of  income  received  by 
 a
private individual or household, often derived from occupational activities,
or income of an individual that is not in the form of a salary (e.g. income
from  investments).  Thus  private  income  includes  factor  income  from  net
domestic product, net factor income from abroad & current transfers from
government.

>Private income = Domestic product accruing to the private sector + Net factor
income from abroad + Net other transfer income.]

5.      (c)   The term was coined by Indian economist Raj Krishna. The Hindu 
rate of
growth is a derogatory term referring to the low annual growth rate of the


socialist economy of India before 1991, which stagnated around 3.5% from
1950s to 1980s.

6.      (a)   GDP  at  factor  cost  is  GDP  at  market  price  minus  
indirect  taxes  plus
subsidies. GDP at factor cost measure the value of output in terms of what
it really cost to produce.

Gross value of output = Value total Sales Goods & Services + Value
of changes in the inventories.

The Sum of net value added in various economic activities is known as GDP at
factor cost.

7.      (a)   Per   capita   income   is   obtained   by   dividing   national  
 income   by   total
population  of  the  country  per  capita  income,  also  known  as  income  per
person, is the mean income of the people in a country. It is calculated by
taking a measure of all sources of income in the aggregate (such as GDP or
Gross national income) and dividing it by the total population.

8.      (d)   GDP is defined as the value of all final goods and services 
produced in an
economy  in  a  year.  The  total  quantity  of  goods  produced  in  an  
economy
during year are multiplied by their current prices to get the GDP.

Gross Domestic Product can be calculated using formulas.

GDP = C + G + I + NX

C - Private consumption or consumer spending in nation economy.
G - Sum of Govt. spending.

I - Sum of all the country’s investment including business Capital expenditure.
NX - Nation’s total next exports

NX = Export – Import

9.      (a)   Depreciation is equal to GNP–NNP (Gross national products–Net 
national
products)

In economic, DepUeciDWion is the gradual decrease in the economic value of the
capital stock of a form nation or other entity.

10.    (d)   Investment  method  is  not  a  method  of  measurement  of  
National  income.
There are three methods of measurement: income method, product or value
added method and the expenditure method.

,nYeVWPenW PeWhod in only appropriate if the property is let or operated
under as management structure by a third party.

,ncoPe  PeWhod     Under  this  method  National  income  is  measured  as  a
flow of factor income.

11.    (d)   Net  National  Product  (NNP)  of  a  country  is  GNP  minus  
depreciation
allowances. NNP is the actual addition to year’s wealth. While calculating
GNP,   we  ignore  depreciation  of  assets  but  in  reality  the  process  of


production uses up the fixed assets or there is some wear and tear or fixed
assets  by  process  of  depreciation.  In  order  to  arrive  at  NNP  we  
deduct
depreciation from GNP.

12.    (b)   National  Income  is  based  on  the  production  of  goods  and  
services.  A
variety of measures of national income and output are used in economics
to estimate total economic activity in a country or region, including gross
domestic  product  (GDP),  gross  national  product  (GNP),  net  national
income  (NNI),  and  adjusted  national  income  (NNI*  adjusted  for  natural
resource depletion).

13.    (a)   Rate of GDP growth is a major indication of the state of the 
economy of a
country. Economic growth is the increase in the market value of the goods
and  services  produced  by  an  economy  over  time.  It  is  conventionally
measured as the percent rate of increase in gross domestic product.

14.    (b)   GNP  is  the  total  value  of  all  final  goods  and  services  
produced  within  a
country in a particular year, plus income earned by its citizens (including
income of those located abroad), minus income of non-residents located in
that  country.  GNP  measures  the  value  of  goods  and  services  that  the
country’s citizens produced regardless of their location.

*UoVV NDWionDO ,ncoPe   It is total domestic and foreign output claimed
by  residents  of  country  consisting  of  GDP  plus  factor  income  earned  
by
foreign  resident  minus  income  earned  in  the  domestic  income  by  non-
resident.

15.    (d)   NNP at factor cost is equivalent to national income. Net National 
Product
at factor cost is the aggregate payments made to the factors of production.
NNP at FC is the total incomes earned by all the factors of production in
the form of wages, profits, rent, interest etc. plus net factor income from
abroad.

16.    (c)   Tertiary  sector  of  the  Indian  economy  contributes  largest  
to  the  GDP.
During  last  decade  tertiary  sector  has  shown  remarkable  expansion.  The
economy  is  divided  into  three  sectors  on  the  basis  of  
activities-primary,
secondary   and   tertiary.   Primary   sector   is   involved   into   
agriculture,
secondary  sector  is  involved  into  manufacturing,  mining,  construction
while  tertiary  sector  is  involved  into  trade,  transport,  communication,
banking & other services. In the last decade, India has expanded maximum
in   providing   services   like   IT,   telecommunication,   healthcare,   
tourism
which is contributing around 60% to GDP.

17.    (c)   Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), prepares the estimates of 
national
income  in  India.  The  first  official  estimates  of  the  national  income,
prepared by the CSO at constant prices with base year 1948-49, as well as
at current prices, were brought out in 1956.

18.    (a)   Service   sector   is   one   of   the   three   economic   
sectors.   it   includes:
telecommunication,       hospitality       industry/tourism,       mass

investment  management,  accountancy,  legal  services,  consulting,  retail
sales,  real  estate,  education.  Maximum  contribution  to  national  income
comes from service sector which contributes more than 50%.

19.    (a)   Dadabhai  Naoroji  had  estimated  national  income  in  India  
first.  National
income estimate before independence was prepared by Dadabhai Naoroji
in   1876.   He   estimated   national   income   by   estimating   the   value 
  of
agricultural   production   and   then   adding   some   percentage   of   non–
agricultural production. This method was non–scientific.

the national income was Dr. VKRV Rao in 1931.

and translator of Ramayan & Mahabharat.

D 5  *DdgiO   A social scientist and the first critic of Indian planning.

20.    (b)   National income is the sum total of wages, rent, interest, and 
profit earned
by the factors of production of a country in a year. Thus it is the aggregate
values  of  goods  and  services  rendered  during  a  given  period  counted
without duplication.

21.    (d)   The  most  appropriate  measure  of  a  country’s  economic  
growth  is  its  per
capita real income. Per capita income is average income, a measure of the
wealth  of  the  population  of  a  nation.  It  is  used  to  measure  a  
country’s
standard of living thus a better indicator of economic growth.

Economic  growth  is  the  increase  in  the  inflation-adjusted  market  value 
 of  the
Goods and services produced by an economy overtime.

22.    (b)   The existence of a parallel economy or black money makes the 
monetary
policies  less  effective.  Parallel  economy,  based  on  the  black  money  or
unaccounted  money,  causes  high  circulation  of  money  in  the  market  and
thus causes inflation etc.

25.    (a)   Personal income- direct taxes + fees+ fines+ social security 
contribution by
employers.  The  amount  of  money  that  households  have  available  for
spending   and   saving   after   income   taxes   have   been   accounted   
for.
Disposable  personal  income  is  often  monitored  as  one  of  the  many  key
economic    indicators    used    to    gauge    the    overall    state    of  
  the
economy.Disposable   income   is   total   personal   income   minus   personal
current taxes.

Disposable Personal Income is the amount of money that households have avail

26.    (c)   The first person to adopt a scientific procedure in estimating the 
national
income was Dr. VKRV Rao in 1931.

28.    (c)

29.    (a)   Imperative planning is not a feature of economic planning of 
India. In case
of imperative planning economic activities belong to public sector. In this
type of planning economic decisions are made through a central planning
authority  instead  of  a  market  system.  There  is  absence  of  
institutions  of
private property, competition and profit motive of industrialists.

30.    (b)   Green  shoots  is  the  first  signs  of  an  improvement  in  an  
economy  that  is
performing  badly.  It  was  first  used  in  this  sense  by  Norman  Lamont,  
the
then Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, during the 1991
recession.

31.    (c)   Inclusive growth is a concept which includes equitable allocation 
to every
section of society. It creates an environment of equality in opportunity in
all  dimensions  such  as  employment  creation,  market,  consumption,  and
production and has created a platform for people who are poor to access a
good standard of living.


32.    (c)   Real Gross Domestic Product (real GDP) is a macroeconomic measure 
of
the value of economic output adjusted for price changes (i.e., inflation or
deflation). Nominal gross domestic product is defined as the market value
of all final goods produced in a geographical region.

33.    (c)   Higher  growth  in  GDP  and  population  can  occur  together.  
Per  capita
income  always  decreases  with  high  population  growth  as  income  per
person decreases with rise in population.

34.    (b)   GDP   deflator   is   an   economic   metric   that   accounts   
for   inflation   by
converting output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The
GDP  deflator  shows  how  much  a  change  in  the  base  year’s  GDP  relies
upon changes in the price level.

35.    (a)   In  India  a  large  number  of  farmers  are  illiterate  and  
know  little  about
scientific-agriculture  methods.  Prices  of  primary  products  are  lower  
than
those  of  manufactured  products  and  investment  in  agriculture  has  been
lower  when  compared  to  investment  in  industry.  All  these  reasons  are
responsible for lower rural income.

36.    (b)   HDI combines three dimensions: A long and healthy life: Life 
expectancy
at birth, Education index: Mean years of schooling and Expected years of
schooling and a decent Standard of living.

37.    (b)   National Income is the Net National product at the factor cost.

38.    (d)   The labour force of an economy is known as the activity rate (also 
called
participation rate). It is shown in per cent and always as a proportion of an
economy. The concept of the ‘demographic dividend’ is related to this rate.

39.    (a)   A dual economy is the existence of two separate economic sectors 
within
one  country,  divided  by  different  levels  of  development,  technology,  
and
different patterns of demand. The concept was originally created by Julius
Herman  Boeke  to  describe  the  coexistence  of  modern  and  traditional
economic sectors in a colonial economy.

40.    (a)   Market  based  economic  climate  refers  back  to  the  financial 
 system  the
place all financial judgements are taken based mostly on the demand and
provide  circumstances  prevailing  out  there.  Government  has  minimal
interference  in  financial  actions.  Private  gamers  are  free  to  supply  
the
items and expertise based mostly on the demand and provides alerts out.

41.    (d)   The planned economy is based on mixed economy system. The concept 
of
mixed economy evolved from the ideas of Keynes. The concept of Mixed
Economy   means   that   both   private   enterprises   and   public   
enterprises
coexist. However the condition attached is that the private enterprises must
work for serving the society rather than having only self interest. Further
the private enterprises may not be allowed in every sector of the economy
like area of national importance.

42.    (b)   The  Human  Development  Index  (HDI)  is  a  composite  statistic 
 of  life

shifts  in  the
beginning of the 1990s. This new model of economic reforms is commonly
known  as  the  LPG  or  Liberalization,  Privatization  and  Globalization
model. LPG model of economic development in India was proposed by Dr.
Manmohan Singh, economist and finance minister at that time.

45.    (c)   The Concurrent List or List-III is a list of 52 items given in 
Part XI of the
Constitution  of  India,  concerned  with  relations  between  the  Union  and
States. Economic planning is specified in Concurrent list.

46.    (c)   The concept of Economic planning in India is derived from Russia.

47.    (a)   The  Twenty  Point  Programme  was  initially  launched  by  Prime 
 Minister
Indira  Gandhi  in  1975  and  was  subsequently  restructured  in  1982  and
again  on  1986.  With  the  introduction  of  new  policies  and  programmes  
it
has  been  finally  restructured  in  2006  and  it  has  been  in  operation  
at
present.  The  basic  objective  of  the  20-Point  Programme  is  to  eradicate
poverty  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the  poor  and  the  
under
privileged population of the country.

48.    (d)   Planning  was  considered  for  balanced  socio-economic  
development  to
focus on removal of regional disparities and maximizing the utilization of
available resources.

49.    (c)   The Second Five <ear Plan heralded in a true sense the Socialist 
Project of
the  then  Prime  Minister,  Jawaharlal  Nehru.  The  economic  policies  of
Nehru were heavily influenced by the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist


Republics (USSR) which had followed the path of speedy industrialisation
to  expand  the  manufacturing  base  of  its  economy.  The  Second  Five  year
Plan focused mainly on heavy industry as against the First Plan which was
essentially   an   agricultural   plan.   This   was   done   to   boost   
domestic
production and manufacturing of goods. Third plan aimed to achieve self-
sufficiency  in  foodgrains  and  to  increase  agricultural  production  to  
meet
the requirements of industry and exports.

50.    (d)   The  Governments  objective  of  inclusive  growth  can  be  
furthered  by
promoting   self   help   groups,   promoting   micro,   small   and   medium
enterprises  and  implementing  the  right  to  education.  This  will  improve
employement opportunities, increase GDP etc.

51.    (d)   The  economy  of  India  had  undergone  significant  policy  
shifts  in  the
beginning of the 1990s. This new model of economic reforms is commonly
known  as  the  LPG  or  Liberalization,  Privatization  and  Globalization
model. LPG model of economic development in India was proposed by Dr.
Manmohan  Singh,  economist  and  finance  minister  at  that  time  under  the
PV Narashimha Rao Government in 1990.

52.    (c)   The  economy  of  India  had  undergone  significant  policy  
shifts  in  the
beginning  of  the  1990s  at  the  time  of  eighth  plan.  This  new  model  
of
economic  reforms  is  commonly  known  as  the  LPG  or  Liberalization,
Privatization    and    Globalization    model.    LPG    model    of    
economic
development  in  India  was  proposed  by  Dr  Manmohan  Singh,  economist
and finance minister at that time. Moreover the Eighth plan envisaged an
annual average growth rate of 5.6% but real growth rate was 6.8%.

53.    (c)   The planning of India derives its objectives and social premises 
followed
by  the  Directive  Principles  of  State  Policy.  The  Directive  Principles  
of
State Policy are guidelines to the central and state governments, to be kept
in  mind  while  framing  laws  and  policies.  These  provisions,  contained  
in
Part IV of the Constitution of India, are not enforceable by any court, but
the   principles   laid   down   therein   are   considered   fundamental   in  
 the
governance of the country.

54.    (b)   Indicative planning is a form of economic planning implemented by 
a state
in  an  effort  to  solve  the  problem  of  imperfect  information  in  market 
 and
mixed  economies  in  order  to  increase  economic  performance.  Regarding
the  indicative  planning,  state  sets  broad  parameters  and  goals  for  the
economy and the targets to be achieved are broadly set by the state.

55.    (b)   In the first Five <ear Plan, the actual GDP growth rate was more 
than the
targeted growth rate.

56.    (a)   LPG   model   of   economic   development   process   in   India   
involves
disinvestment of profit making public sector enterprises, permitting private


sectors to establish industrial units without taking a licence and chronically
sick  industries  were  referred  to  BIFR  for  the  formulation  of  revival  
or
rehabilitation.

57.    (c)   Indicative planning is peculiar to the mixed economy. In a mixed 
economy,
the  public  and  private  sectors  work  together.  In  indicative  planning  
the
private sector is neither rigidly controlled nor directed to fulfill the targets
and  priorities  of  the  plan.  The  state  provides  all  types  of  
facilities  to  the
private sector but does not direct it, rather indicates the areas in which it
can   help   in   implementing   the   plan.   Under   imperative   planning   
all
economic  activities  and  resources  of  the  economy  operate  under  the
direction  of  the  state.  There  is  complete  control  over  the  factors  of
production  by  the  state.  There  is  no  consumer’s  sovereignty  in  such
planning.

58.    (d)   Physical  planning  refers  to  the  allocation  of  resources  in 
 terms  of  men,
materials  and  machinery.  In  physical  planning,  an  overall  assessment  is
made of the available real resources such as raw materials, manpower, etc.,
and  how  they  have  to  be  obtained  so  that  bottlenecks  may  be  
eliminated
during the plan. Physical planning requires the fixation of physical targets
with  regard  to  agricultural  and  industrial  production,  socio-cultural  
and
transportation services, consumption levels and in respect of employment,
income and investment levels of the economy. Physical planning has to be
viewed as an overall long-term planning rather than a short-term piecemeal
planning.

Financial  planning  refers  to  the  technique  of  planning  in  which  
resources  are
allocated  in  terms  of  money.  Financial  planning  is  essential  in  order 
 to
remove maladjustments between supplies and demand and for calculating
costs  and  benefits  of  the  various  projects.  Thus,  Financial  planning  
is
thought to secure a balance between demands and supplies, avoid inflation
and bring about economic stability.

59.    (d)   Agriculture (crops) and allied sectors are like forestry, logging 
and fishing.
Food  processing  is  not  included  in  the  Agriculture  and  allied  
services  of
Indian Economy.

60.    (d)   Agriculture is the pillar of the Indian economy because of its 
high share in
employment and livelihood creation.

Agriculture  and  allied  activities  are  largest  contributor  to  GDP  
accounting  for
27% of the total economy.

61.    (c)   Agriculture  and  Allied  sectors  contribute  less  than  20%  
around  17%  of
Gross  Domestic  product  of  India.  Around  60%  of  net  sown  agricultural
area of India is depended on rainfall.


62.    (b)   Per capita income, also known as income per person, is the mean 
income
of the people in an economic unit such as a country. Per capita income is
often used to measure a country’s standard of living.

PoYeUWy  5DWio  :  Ratio  of  number  of  people  whose  income  falls  below
poverty  sine,  taken  as  half  the  medium  house  hold  income  of  total
population.

NDWionDO ,ncoPe : Total amount of money earned within a country.
UnePpOoye  UDWe  :  It  is  defined  most  basically  as  the  percentage  of  
total
labour  force  that  is  unemployed  but  actively  seeking  employment  and
willing to work.

63.    (a)   The  Atkinson  index  is  a  measure  of  income  inequality  
developed  by
British  economist  Anthony  Barnes  Atkinson.  The  measure  is  useful  in
determining which end of the distribution contributed most to the observed
inequality.

64.    (a)   The economy of the France is the world’s largest single national 
economy.
It has the highest percentage of the services sector in the GDP equivalent
to 79.8%.

Service sector percentage for India is 56.9%

65.    (b)   A greater proportion of the population is between age 20 and 30.

66.    (d)

NIFA = GNP-GDP

NIFA : refers to the net flow of property income to and from the rest of world
plus the net flow of compensation of employer.

67.    (d)   The most appropriate measure of the country’s economic growth is 
its “per
capita   real   income”   which   is   also   denoted   as   NNP   at   factor  
 cost
population.

68.    (c)

69.    (a)   HDI is the geometric mean of (i) Life Expectancy Index (LEI), 
Education
Index (EI) and Income Index (II).

where 20 and 82.3 are the minimum and maximum values of expectancy of life
at birth in years.

where M<SI Mean <ears of Schooling Index


E<SI Expected <ears of Schooling Index

100  and  107721  are  the  minimum  and  maximum  values  of  Per  Capita  
Gross
National Income in US $.

70.    (b)   Statement   2   is   correct   as   it   comes   under   the   
perview   of   non-
resident/International resident.

71.    (a)   Negative  Inflation  is  decrease  in  price  level  and  economic 
 growth  is
defined as GDP rise. A decrease in inflation means the prices has fallen.
So,  there  is  increase  in  purchasing  power  of  money.  It  is  increased
consumption therefore GDP increases.

72.    (d)   National Income ignores sale of land.

73.    (a)   Typically,   higher   inflation   is   caused   by   strong   
economic   growth.   If
Aggregate demand in an economy expanded faster than aggregate supply,
we would expect to see a higher inflation rate. If demand is rising faster
than  supply,  then  this  suggests  that  economic  growth  is  higher  than  
the
long run sustainable rate of growth.

74.    (b)   The  effect  of  a  government  surplus  upon  the  equilibrium  
level  of  NNP
(Net   National   Product)   is   substantially   the   same   as   an   
increase   in
consumption.

75.    (c)   Share of food in total consumption expenditure has been coming 
down as
per  capita  income  grew  over  time  in  last  sixty  years  because  growth  
in
food per capita income expenditure has been lower than growth in other.

76.    (a)   The  sum  of  a  nation’s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  plus  
net  income
received from overseas. Gross national income (GNI) is defined as the sum
of  value  added  by  all  producers  who  are  residents  in  a  nation,  plus 
 any
product  taxes  (minus  subsidies)  not  included  in  output,  plus  income
received   from   abroad   such   as   employee   compensation   and   property
income.

77.    (a)   National  product  at  factor  cost  is  equal  to  net  domestic  
product  at  factor
cost+ Net factor Income from Abroad.

78.    (b)   The first person to adopt a scientific procedure in estimating the 
national
income was DU  9 . 5 9 5Do in 1931.

79.    (a)   During  first  Five  <ear  Plan  1951–56  the  price  level  in  
Indian  economy
showed a decline because of rapid agricultural development and measures


to  control  inflation  as  there  was  disequilibrium  due  to  second  world  
war
and partition of economy.

80.    (d)   The National Development Council (NDC) or the Rashtriya Vikas 
Parishad
is  the  apex  body  for  decision  making  and  deliberations  on  development
matters in India, presided over by the Prime Minister. The functions of the
Council  are  to  prescribe  guidelines  for  the  formulation  of  the  
National
Plan; to consider the National Plan as formulated by the NITI Aayog; to
consider  important  questions  of  social  and  economic  policy  affecting
national development; and to review the working of the Plan from time to
time and to recommend such measures as are necessary for achieving the
aims and targets set out in the National Plan.

81.    (c)   The slogan of ‘poverty abolition’ was given by Indira Gandhi in 
1971 and
it  was  implemented  during  the  Fifth  Five  <ear  Plan  1974–79.  Gandhi
promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor
and enact wide ranging social and economic reforms.

2nd plan - ‘Socialist pattern & life’
4th plan - ‘Garibi Hatao’

6th plan - ‘‘Rolling plan’ taken from Japan coined by Gunnar Myrdal.

82.    (a)   Under the Third Five <ear Plan, the government introduced an 
agricultural
strategy which gave rise to green revolution in India. Under the Third Plan
the goal was to establish self reliance and self generating economy.

83.    (a)   The  major  emphasis  in  the  First  Five  <ear  plan  was  on  
the  agriculture
sector. At the time of first plan (1951–56), India faced severe food shortage
and inflation. Accordingly the first plan emphasized on rapid agricultural
development so as to achieve food self sufficiency and control inflation.

Target Growth rate was 201% annual GDP Achieved growth Rate was 3.6% &
the Net domestic product went up by 15%.

84.    (b)   The Fourth Five-<ear Plan is also called “Gadgil <ojana”. The aim 
of this
plan was to make the economy independent and to reach self active take
off position. It was named after the then deputy chairman of the Planning
Commission Dr. D R Gadgil.

85.    (b)   Due  to  miserable  failure  of  3rd  plan,  the  govt  was  
forced  to  declare  plan
holidays  (from  1966-67,  1967-68,  1968-69),  the  target  growth  rate  was
5.6%, but the actual was 2.4%.

86.    (c)   The  service  sector  experienced  the  fastest  expansion  during 
 the  plan  in
India  which  was  predominantly  an  agricultural  economy  at  the  time  of
independence.        It        includes:        telecommunication,        
hospitality
industry/tourism,      mass      media,      healthcare/hospitals,      
information
technology,   banking,   insurance,   investment   management,   accountancy,
legal  services,  consulting,  retail  sales,  real  estate,  education.  
currently


maximum  contribution  to  national  income  comes  from  service  sector
which contributes around 60%.

87.    (b)   The National Development Council (NDC) or the Rashtriya Vikas 
Parishad
is  the  apex  body  for  decision-making  and  deliberations  on  development
matters  in  India,  presided  over  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The  National
Development Council is the final authority to adopt the Five <ear Plan for
the  country.

88.    (c)   Faster and more inclusive growth is the theme of the approach 
paper of the
Eleventh  five  year  plan.  The  Inclusive  growth  in  eleventh  plan  has  
the
objectives   of   increasing   GDP,   Agricultural   GDP,   Increasing   work
opportunities,   developing   education,   providing   clean   drinking   water,
reducing  malnutrition,  increasing  energy  efficiency,  healthcare  
facilities

,road  connectivity,  broadband  connectivity  to  villages,  increasing  forest
etc.

89.    (b)   Sixth five year plan started in 1980-85 marked the beginning of 
economic
liberalization  in  India.  In  Sixth  Five  year  plan,  a  shift  in  pattern 
 of
Industrialisation with lower emphasis on the heavy industry and move on
infrastructure begins.

90.    (c)   During  The  eleventh  plan  (2007-12)  the  food  grain  
production  steadily
increased and the average inflation on the wholesale price Index was above
10%.

91.    (b)   Under the third five year plan, the government introduced an 
agricultural
strategy which gave rise to green revolution in India. Under the third plan
the goal was to establish self reliance and self generating economy.But the
earlier  plans  had  shown  that  the  agricultural  production  was  the  
limiting
factor; so agriculture was given top priority.

92.    (d)   The   Mahatma   Gandhi   National   Rural   Employment   Guarantee 
  Act
(MNREGA) is an Indian law that aims to guarantee the ‘right to work’ and
ensures livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of
guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose
adult  members  volunteer  to  do  unskilled  manual  work.  MNREGA  was
launched in 200 select districts in 2006. However Indira Awas <ojana was
lauched in the <ear 1996.

93.    (b)   In  the  fifth  five  year  plan,  the  concept  of  ‘minimum  
needs’  and  directed
anti-poverty    programmes    were    innovated.    The    Minimum    needs
Programme aimed to establish a network of basic services to raise living
standards  and  in  reducing  the  regional  disparities  in  development.  The
basic  needs  of  the  people  identified  for  this  programme  are  Elementary
Education,    Adult    Education,    Rural    Health,    Rural    Roads,    
Rural


Electrification, Rural Housing. Moreover, it was during the plan, slogan of
‘Garibi hatao’ was given to remove poverty.

94.    (d)   In  the  11th  Five  <ear  Plan,  the  growth  rate  of  the  
agriculture  sector  was
3.3% and the agriculture sector contributed 15.2 % in the overall GDP of
the country. Thus Both the given statements regarding the 11th Five <ear
Plan are not correct.

95.    (c)   The  Ninth  Five  <ear  Plan  was  launched  in  the  50th  year  
of  India’s
independence. Under the plan for the first time in the Indian Economy the
GDP growth rate was set at 7%.

96.    (c)   The Twelfth Five <ear Plan approved by the government aims to 
sustain
the  inclusive  growth  which  started  in  11th  plan.  12th  Five  <ear  Plan 
 is
from 2012 to 2017 and it aims to grow GDP at the rate of 9%.

97.    (b)   Regarding the 11th Five <ear Plan, in the middle of the plan, the 
import
growth  was  negative  due  to  external  factors  and  the  growth  rate  of  
the
export was negative during certain periods.

98.    (c)   First plan – agriculture, Irrigation and power projects
Third Plan – self reliance and generating economy

Fifth Plan – growth with social justice
Twelfth plan – sustainable inclusive growth

99.    (c)   Jawahar Rozgar <ojna was launched on April 1, 1989 by merging 
National
Rural  Employment  Program  (NREP)  and  Rural  Landless  Employment
Guarantee  Programme  (RLEGP).  In  Seventh  Five  <ear  Plan  the  small-
scale and food processing industries were given new impetus as the plan
laid stress on improving the productivity level of industries by upgrading
technology.

100.  (b)   Despite big investments during the first three Plans the living 
standards of
the  poor  could  not  be  raised  and  poverty  and  inequity  in  
distribution  of
state resources remained stark. Consequently, the period between 1966 and
1969  marked  the  shift  from  a  ‘growth  approach’  to  a  ‘distribution  
from
growth   approach’.   Looking   at   the   failures   and   pitfalls   the   
planners
suspended the impending Fourth Plan, which was due in 1966, until 1969
for  a  revision  of  objectives  and  targets.  This  was  called  as  the  
‘Plan
Holiday’ extending from 1 April 1966 to 31 March 1969.

101.  (d)   The Fourth Five Plan was formed for the years 1969 to 1974. It was 
the
first plan that the government of Ms Indira Gandhi launched. The plan was
put  forward  when  the  country  was  under  the  pressure  of  inflationary
recession  and  devaluation.  The  plan  aimed  for  a  5.5  percent  growth  
but
ended up achieving a mere 3.3 percent growth.

102.  (a)


103.  (c)   During  the  Eighth  Five  <ear  Plan,  the  Indian  Economy  
adopted  the
indicative  planning  model.  Indicative  planning  is  a  form  of  economic
planning  implemented  by  a  state  in  an  effort  to  solve  the  problem  of
imperfect information in market and mixed economies in order to increase
economic   performance.   When   utilizing   indicative   planning,   the   
state
employs “influence, subsidies, grants, and taxes.

104.  (b)   Fifth  F<P  was  launched  and  planned  for  the  period  1974-79  
but  Janata
Government came in power in 1978 and terminated the plan prematurely
in 1978. The Janata government launched sixth F<P for period 1978-1983.
Congress  government  when  came  in  power  in  1980  abandoned  the  sixth
F<P and launched a new sixth F<P for period 1980-1985.

105.  (c)   National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD) 
 is  an
apex  development  bank  in  India  having  headquarters  in  Mumbai.  It  was
established on 12 July, 1982 in sixth five year plan by a special act by the
Parliament  and  its  main  focus  was  to  uplift  rural  India  by  
increasing  the
credit flow for elevation of agriculture and rural non-farm sector.

106.  (c)   The  fourth  five  year  plan  was  affected  by  the  immigration  
of  a  huge
population  from  Bangladesh.  It  was  affected  since  the  situation  in  
East
Pakistan was really tense and the funds actually allocated for the industrial
development  were  taken  up  to  wage  the  Indo-Pakistani  war  and  the
Bangladesh Liberation War.

107.  (c)   The Ninth Plan treats education as the most crucial investment in 
human
development.   The   plan   had   the   national   goal   of   providing   
primary
education   as   a   universal   basic   service,   and   the   Supreme   Court 
  also
declared education to be a fundamental right for children upto 14 years of
age

108.  (c)   The Hindu rate of growth is a derogatory term referring to the low 
annual
growth rate of the planned economy of India before the liberalizations of
1991, which stagnated around 3.5% from 1950s to 1980s, while per capita
income growth averaged 1.3%. The term was coined by Indian economist
Raj Krishna.

109.  (d)   In Tenth year five plan: the target for the crop. function were not 
fixed for
the first time

110.  (c)   The  growth  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  
fluctuating
across the plan periods . It witnessed a growth rate of 4.8 per cent during
the Eighth plan period 1992–97.

111.  (a)   The  growth  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  
fluctuating
across the plan periods. It witnessed a growth rate of 4.8 per cent during
the Eighth plan period 1992–97.


112.  (c)   According  to  the  Second  Five  <ear  Plan  the  priorities  were 
 given  in  the
production of iron and steel and heavy engineering and also to strengthen
the oil exploration and coal.

113.  (b)   The  Fifth  Five  <ear  Plan  1974-79  had  a  high  priority  to 
 bring  inflation
under control and to achieve stability in the economic situation.

114.  (c)   The  third  five  year  plan  1961-1966  had  objective  to  
increase  wheat
production and other agricultural products.

115.  (c)   The  Fourteenth  Finance  Commission  wants  the  states  to  share 
 a  larger
fiscal responsibility for the implementation of the scheme.

116.  (c)   A.  First    Five    <ear    Plan    (1951-56-    Agriculture

120.  (a)

121.  (a)   As per report of the working group on animal husbandary and 
dairying -
11th  5 year plan, the livestock sector employs 8% of the country’s labour
force.

122.  (b)   The Second Plan was particularly in the development of the public 
sector.
The  plan  followed  the  Mahalanobis  model,  an  economic  development
model developed by the Indian statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis
in 1953.

123.  (b)   Agriculture sector grew by an average 1.6 per cent per annum in 
first four
years of the ongoing Five <ear Plan 2012-17 as against the targeted 4 per


cent annual growth due to lower production.

124.  (a)   The  First  Five-year  Plan  was  launched  in  1951  which  mainly 
 focused  in
development   of   the   primary   sector,   and   was   based   on   the   
Harrod–
Domar model with few modifications.

125.  (d)   Suppose three people work in farm, produce 200 kg wheat. If one of 
them
is   removed,   still   farm   produces   200   kg   wheat.   That   is   
disguised
unemployment marginal productivity is zero.

126.  (a)   To   rip   maximum   demographic   dividend,   India   has   to   
promote   skill
development.

127.  (c)

Disguised unemployment exist where part of labour force is either left without
work  or  working  in  a  redundant  manner  where  worker  productivity  is
essentially zero.

129.  (a)   Prof.  Tendulkar’s  pioneering  contribution  was  his  extensive  
work  on
poverty and estimation of people below poverty line (BPL. A committee
was formed by government of India in 2009, with Tendulkar as Chairman
to  ‘report  on  methodology  for  estimation  of  poverty’.  In  2009,  this
committee came out with a new method to calculate poverty.

130.  (d)   The poverty ratio was highest in Chhattisgarh at 39.93 per cent 
followed
by  Jharkhand  (36.96  per  cent,  Manipur  (36.89  per  cent,  Arunachal
Pradesh (34.67 per cent and Bihar (33.47 per cent. As per 2011-12 data.

The minimum poverty ratio was 5.09%.

National Average of all states of India was 21.92%

PoYeUWy UDWio : The ratio of the no. of people whose income falls below
the  poverty  line,  taken  as  half  the  median  household  income  of  the  
total
population.

131.  (b)   According to the data studied by Planning Commission in 2011–12, 
21.9%

132.  (b)   In   Indian   economy   the   sectors   from   highest   to   
lowest   in   terms   of
employment are agriculture sector around 50%, service sector around 35%
and Industrial sector.

133.  (d)   Phillips  curve  is  a  historical  inverse  relationship  between  
the  rate  of
unemployment  and  the  rate  of  inflation  in  an  economy.  Philip’s  curve
stated that the lower the unemployment in an economy, the higher the rate
of inflation.

*iEUDW’V  ODZ:  It  is  rule  defined  by  Gibrat  in  1931  stating  that  the
proportional rate of growth of a form in independent of absolute size.

9eUdooUn’V  ODZ:  It  is  rule  which  states  that  in  the  long  run  
productivity
generally grows proportionally to the square root of output.


134.  (c)   A  Beveridge  curve,  or  UV-curve,  is  a  graphical  
representation  of  the
relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate (the number
of unfilled jobs expressed as a proportion of the labour force. It typically
has  vacancies  on  the  vertical  axis  and  unemployment  on  the  horizontal.
The curve is named after William Beveridge.

Friedman’s  Curve  :  It  is  a  graph  that  obstetric  care  provides  have  
traditionally
used to define a normal length and Pace of labour.

135.  (a)

136.  (c)   The long-run Phillips curve is now seen as a vertical line at the 
natural rate
of   unemployment,   where   the   rate   of   inflation   has   no   effect   
on
unemployment.

137.  (c)   Tendulkar adopted the Cost of living as the basis for identifying 
poverty. It
was also accepted by the panel under the leadership of Arvind Panagariya,
Constituted   by   the   Govt.   in   September   2016.   However   This   Panel
suggested the Govt. to constitute another panel to define poverty.

138.  (b)   According  to  Prof.  Nurkse,  Vicious  Circle  of  Poverty  
implies  circular
constellation of forces tending to act and react one another in such a way
as            to keep a poor country in a state of poverty.

141.  (a)   In India, agriculture, forestry and logging, fishing, mining and 
quarrying,
registered  manufacturing  and  construction  units  are  included  in  
category

A. The output method is applied to category A. The value added by this
category  is  found  by  subtracting  the  value  of  raw  materials  and  other
inputs from the aggregate of commodity-wise output.

([pendiWXUe MeWhod-This method measure National income sum total of
final   expenditure   incurred   by   household,   business   firm,   Govt.   &
Foreigners.

CoPPodiWy fOoZ PeWhod - This method is used to estimate purchase of
commodity  by  intermediate  or  final  users.  This  method  generally  begins
with an estimate of the total supply of a commodity available for domestic
users.

142.  (c)   Statement  1  lists  all  the  main  and  primary  sources  of  
agricultural  credit
institutions exclusively for farmers.

143.  (d)   The  Green  Revolution  in  India  was  a  period  where  
Agriculture  in  India
increased  its  yield  due  to  improved  agronomic  technology,  the  main
development was higher yielding varieties of wheat.


144.  (d)   The Green Revolution in India has contributed to inter-regional, 
inter-class
and inter-crop inequality as certain regions like UP and Punjab which used
H<Vs performed much better than others and become more advanced than
other states.

145.  (d)   The  importance  of  agriculture  in  Indian  Economy  is  
indicated  by  its
contribution  to  national  income,  industrial  development  and  supply  of
foodgrains. It contributes around 13.7% to GDP, supplies raw material for
development of industries along with supplying food grains for livelihood.

Agriculture  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  Indian  economy  over  70%  of  
the  rural
households  depend  upon  Agricultural.  Agriculture  in  an  important  sector
of  Indian  economy  as  it  contributes  about  17%  to  the  total  GDP  and
provide employment to over 60% of population.

146.  (b)   Indian  Farmers  Fertilizer  cooperative  Ltd  (IFFCO)  is  the  
co-operative
society responsible for the production of fertilizers. IFFCO was registered
on November 3, 1967 as a Multi-unit Co-operative Society.

NCDC    :    National    Co-operative    Development    Co-operation    was
established  by  the  Act  of  parliament  in  1963  as  a  statutory  
co-operation
under the ministry of Agriculture.

147.  (d)   The introduction of high-yielding varieties of seeds and the 
increased use
of chemical fertilizers and irrigation are known collectively as the Green
Revolution.  The  impact  of  the  Green  Revolution  was  felt  most  in  the
production  of  wheat.  India  saw  annual  wheat  production  rise  from  10
million tons in the 1960s to 73 million in 2006.

148.  (a)   The  Blue  Revolution  is  similar  to  the  green  revolution  as  
it  deals  with
aquaculture, fish and water preservation for human use.

Blue Revolution Fish Production
Green Revolution - Food grains
White Revolution - Milk production

<ellow Revolution - Oil seed production

149.  (b)   Guranteed maximum prices have not been a component of the 
agriculture
strategy  that  brought  about  the  Green  Revolution.  The  strategy  aimed  
at
increasing the yield of crops using fertilizer, pesticides and high yielding
varities in agriculture.

150.  (d)   The term ‘Green Revolution’ has been used to indicate higher 
production
through enhanced agricultural productivity per hectare.

New agricultural techniques were introduced as a package programme to include
high yielding variety seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.

151.  (d)   Agriculture,  dairy,  horticulture  and  related  occupations

the  agriculture
sector and provides self-employment to about 21 million people. Growth


of livestock output averaged 4.8 per cent per annum during the Eleventh
Plan recovering from an average of 3.6 per cent in the Ninth and theTenth
Plans.

164.  (d)   The  importance  of  agriculture  in  Indian  Economy  is  
indicated  by  its
contribution  to  national  income,  industrial  development  and  supply  of
foodgrains. It contributes around 13.7% to GDP, supplies raw material for
development of industries along with supplying foodgrains for livelihood.

165.  (d)   Regarding to minimum support price neither of the statements given 
above
is correct. In order to help the farmers in getting remunerative prices for
their  produce  with  a  view  to  encourage  higher  investment  and  also  to
increase production and productivity of a commodity, Government of India
declares  Minimum  Support  Price  (MSPs  for  25  notified  agricultural

(NAFED)
promotes cooperative marketing, promotes the inter-state trade as well as
export of certain agricultural commodities to many foreign countries. It is
responsible  in  stabilizing  prices  of  commodities  and  thus  responsible  
for
the movement of the essential commodities from surplus areas to scarcity
areas.

172.  (a)

173.  (c)   The  area  under  foodgrains  has  declined  in  the  last  two  
decades  and  the
average farm size in the country is very small and declining over the years.

174.  (c)   The Indian dairy sector has acquired substantial growth momentum 
from
the  Ninth  Five-<ear  Plan  onwards,  as  a  result  of  which  the  country  
now


ranks  first  among  the  world’s  milk  producing  nations.  The  per  capita
availability  of  the  milk  has  reached  a  level  of  337g  per  day  in  
the  year
2017, which is more than the world average of 229g per day.

175.  (a)   The Commission of Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP since 1985, 
earlier
named as Agricultural Prices Commission came into existence in January
1965.  It  is  mandated  to  recommend  minimum  support  prices  MSPs  to
incentivize   the   cultivators   to   adopt   modern   technology,   and   
raise
productivity   and   overall   grain   production   in   line   with   the   
emerging
demand patterns in the country.

176.  (c)   These exports have marked a growth of 0.8 in the year 2012-13.

66th  NSSO  Round  were  responsible  for  around  42  per  cent  of  food
inflation  during  the  latter  period.  This  signifies  that  protein  
sources  of
food,  both  plant  and  animal,  have  emerged  an  important  driver  of  food
inflation in recent period.

178.  (b)   A   study   conducted   in   2014   found   that   there   are   
three   specific
characteristics  associated  with  high  risk  farmers:  “those  that  grow  
cash
crops    such as coffee and cotton; those with ‘marginal’ farms of less than
one hectare; and those with debts of 300 Rupees or more.” The study also
found  that  the  Indian  states  in  which  these  three  characteristics  are 
 most
common had the highest suicide rates and also accounted for “almost 75%
of    the variability in state-level suicides.

PUiPDUy SecWoUV - Primary activities are those which are based on natural
resource. It is called Agriculture sector.

Examples - Types of crops, live stock rearing dairy farming, fishing,"
SecondDUy SecWoUV - Secondary sector follows primary activities in which
the  natural  products  are  changed  to  manufacture.  It  is  called  
Industrial
sector.

7eUWiDUy  SecWoU  -  Activities  that  assist  the  development  of  primary  
and
secondary  sectors  are  carried  out.  Generally  services  are  involved  like
doctors,  teachers,  lawyers,  administrators.  New  services  like  IT,  
software
company etc. have become important Tertiary activities.

185.  (c)   When development in economy takes place, the share of tertiary 
sector in
national  income  keeps  on  increasing  because  tertiary  sector  is  involved
into   services   within   and   outside   the   country.   With   development  
 the
disposable  income  of  individuals  income  results  in  growth  of  banking,
trading, communication etc., both domestically and internationally.

the Indian economy.


191.  (c)   The Millenium Development Goals focus on developing countries. There
is one exception : MDG number 8 on developing a global partnership for
development, which includes commitments for developed countries to help
developing  countries.  An  important  difference  is  that  the  sustainable
Development   Goals   are   meant   to   apply   to   all   countries,   
including
developed countries.

Another  difference  is  that  the  sustainable  Development  Goals  are  
explicitly
meant   to   include   the   three   dimensions   of   sustainable   development
economic, social and environmental.

192.  (d)   Quaternary sector is characterized by the intellectual persons or
