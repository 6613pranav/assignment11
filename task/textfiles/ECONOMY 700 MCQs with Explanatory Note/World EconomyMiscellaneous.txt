CodeV:

(a)   Both (a) and (R) are correct, and (R) is the correct explanation of (a).

(b)   Both (a) and (R) are correct, but (R) is not the correct explanation of 
(a).

(c)   (a) is correct, but (R) is incorrect.

(d)   (a) is incorrect, but (R) is correct.

83.    Assertion  (a)  :  In  short  run,  the  marginal  cost  of  output  is

associated   with   Cambridge   University,   took   a   slightly   different
approach to the quantity theory, focusing on money demand instead of
money supply. The Baumol-Tobin model is an economic model of the
Transactions   demand   for   money   as   developed   independently   by
William Baumol 1952 and James Tobin .

103.(a)  Functional Finance is a heterodox macroeconomic theory developed by
Abba  Lerner  during  World  War  II  that  seeks  to  eliminate  economic
insecurity (i.e., the business cycle) through government intervention in
the   economy.   Functional   finance   emphasizes   the   end   result   of
interventionist  policies  on  the  economy  and  is  based  on  three  major
beliefs:

1.     It  is  the  role  of  government  to  stave  off  inflation  and  
unemployment  by
controlling  consumer  spending  through  the  raising  and  lowering  of
taxes.

2.     The  purpose  of  government  borrowing  and  lending  is  to  control  
interest
rates, investment levels and inflation.

3.     The government should print, hoard or destroy money as it sees fit to 
achieve
these goals.

104.(a)   In  WTO  terminology,  subsidies  in  general  are  identified  by  
“boxes”
which are given the colours of traffic lights: green (permitted), amber
(slow down — i.e. be reduced), red (forbidden). In agriculture, things
are, as usual, more complicated. The Agriculture Agreement has no red
box,  although  domestic  support  exceeding  the  reduction  commitment
levels  in  the  amber  box  is  prohibited;  and  there  is  a  blue  box  for
subsidies that are tied to programmes that limit production.

In order to qualify for the “green box”, a subsidy must not distort trade, or at
most cause minimal distortion. These subsidies have to be government-
funded (not by charging consumers higher prices) and must not involve
price  support.  They  tend  to  be  programmes  that  are  not  directed  at
particular products, and include direct income supports for farmers that
are not related to (are “decoupled” from) current production levels or
prices.  “Green  box”  subsidies  are  therefore  allowed  without  limits,
provided they comply with relevant criteria.

105.(a)   The theory of critical minimum effort is associated with the name of
Harvey  Leibenstein.  The  theory  is  based  on  the  relationship  between
the three factors, viz. (i) per capita income, (ii) population growth, and

(iii)  investment.  Leibenstein  identified  population  also  an  income-
depressing  factor  (or  a),  whereas  investment  is  an  income-generating
factor.

organizations
created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. They are: The World
Bank, The International Monetary Fund.

108.(b)   Hirschman introduces the concept of backward and forward linkages.
A  forward  linkage  is  created  when  investment  in  a  particular  project
encourages investment in subsequent stages of production. A backward
linkage  is  created  when  a  project  encourages  investment  in  facilities
that  enable  the  project  to  succeed.  Normally,  projects  create  both
forward  and  backward  linkages.  Investment  should  be  made  in  those
projects that have the greatest total number of linkages. Projects with
many  linkages  will  vary  from  country  to  country;  knowledge  about
project linkages can be obtained through input and output studies.

109.  (c)   Fisher  has  discovered  weighted  index  number  in  which  he  
try  to
calculate best index number because he has taken both current and past
years quantity as the base of price index number. The main quality of
fisher index number is that it qualify both time reversal test and factor
reversal test.

110.  (c)   In monetary economics, the quantity theory of money states that 
money
supply has a direct, proportional relationship with the price level. For
example,  if  the  currency  in  circulation  increased,  there  would  be  a
proportional increase in the price of goods.

 important
commodities - water, iron and coal. Water in Britain’s numerous hilly
districts  provides  the  power  to  drive  mills  in  the  early  stages  of
industrialization;  the  rivers,  amplified  from  1761  by  a  developing
network  of  canals,  facilitate  inland  transport  in  an  age  where  roads


were only rough tracks; and the sea, never far from any parts of Britain,
makes transport of heavy goods easy between coastal cities.

115.  (b)   The WBG came into formal existence on 27 December 1945 following

help Europe rebuild after World War II. Its mission is defined by two
goals - to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to boost prosperity among
the poorest 40 percent in low- and middle-income countries. The World
Bank comprises of five institutions. They are :

(1)   International Bank for Reconstruction and Development(IBRD),

(2)   The International Development Association (IDA),

(3)   The International Finance Corporation (IFC),

(4)   The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)

(5)   International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes(ICSID).

116.  (a)   The IMF is a UN’s specialized agency. IMF was formed in 1944 at the
Bretton    Woods    Conference    to    promote    international    economic
cooperation,   international   trade,   employment,   and   exchange-rate
stability, including by making financial resources available to member
countries to meet balance-of-payments needs.

the world’s trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is
to  help  producers  of  goods  and  services,  exporters  and  importers
conduct their business. The Uruguay Round led to the creation of the
World Trade Organization, with GATT remaining as an integral part of
the WTO agreements. The agreements fall into a simple structure with
six  main  parts,  intellectual  property  (Agreement  on  Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)) was one of them.

technology
advancement.

into  primary  products.  Agriculture  comes  in  the  Primary  sector  of
India’s economy.

131.  (c)   Indian  economy  is  a  true  example  of  complete  mixed  
economy.  This

trade between China and Zimbabwe and acceptability with customers
in Zimbabwe.
