1.      (a)   DeYeOopPenWDO ([pendiWXUe - the expenditure which is incurred
on  activities  directly  related  to  economic  development  is  called
developmental  expenditure.  Expenditure  occurred  on  education,
health     care, scientific research, infrastructure etc.

Non  DeYeOopPenWDO  ([pendXWXUe  -  Expenditure  incurred  on
general essential services required for normal running of the Govt.
is   non   developmental   expenduture.   Expenditure   occurred   on
service   relating   to   general   administration,   police,   judiciary,
defense is non developmental expenditure.

2.      (d)   Coal mines is not an example of economic overheads. Economic
overhead   is   capital   investment   into   the   infrastructure   which
should  encourage  new  industrial  growth  and  social  well  being.
The other three School, sanitary facilities and roads and railways
are economic overheads.

Overheads are indirect cost which cannot be traced into any specified
cost objects.

3.      (a)   All expenditures that promote economic growth and development
are    termed    as    development    expenditure.    Expenditure    on
infrastructure development, public enterprises or development of
agriculture increase productive capacity in the economy and bring
income   to   the   government.   Expenditures   in   the   nature   of
consumption such as Defence, interest payments, expenditure on
law       and order, public administration, do not create any productive
asset  which  can  bring  income  or  returns  to  the  government  are
non-development expenditure.

Govt. grant is a financial award given by the federal State local Govt. to
an eligible grantee.

4.      (c)

5.      (c)   Zero-based  budgeting  is  an  approach  to  planning  and  
decision-
making   which   reverses   the   working   process   of   traditional
budgeting. In zero-based budgeting, every line item of the budget
must    be  approved,  rather  than  only  changes.  During  the  review
process, no reference is made to the previous level of expenditure.
Regarding   zero   Base   Budgeting   (ZBB)   existing   government


programme can be discarded under ZBB if they are found to be
outdated.  Moreover  ZBB  is  difficult  to  be  applied  to  Human
Development programmes as the outcome of such programmes is
intangible in nature.

6.      (d)   Austerity   describes   policies   used   by   governments   to   
reduce
budget   deficits   during   adverse   economic   conditions.   These
policies may include spending cuts, tax increases. This is done in
economic  crisis  situation  to  improve  the  credit  rating  of  the
countries going through adverse economic condition.

7.      (a)   Government   debt   is   the   debt   owed   by   central   
government.
Government  usually  borrows  by  issuing  securities,  government
bonds,   bills   through   Provident   funds   etc.   However   pension
policies are not included in the list.

8.      (b)   Current  account  deficit  is  a  measurement  of  a  country’s  
trade  in
which the value of goods and services it imports exceeds the value
of  goods  and  services  it  exports.  Increase  in  crude  oil  price  and
rise in import of services oil increase the current account deficit.
However increase in exports will reduce the deficit.

9.      (d)   All these statements are components of internal debt.

10.    (a)   Deficit  financing  is  a  pragmatic  tool  of  economic  
development
and has been used by Indian govt. to obtain necessary resources to
finance the five year plans.

11.    (d)   The  definition  of  deficit  financing  is  likely  to  vary  
with  the
purpose for which such a definition is needed.

In  one  sense  by  deficit  financing  we  mean  the  excess  of  government
expenditure  over  its  normal  receipts  raised  by  taxes,  fees,  and
other   sources.   In   this   definition   such   expenditure   whether
obtained through borrowing or from the banking system measures
the  budget  deficit.  Deficit  financing  is  said  to  have  been  used
whenever government expenditure exceeds its receipts.

In under-developed countries deficit financing may be in two forms:

(i)    Difference between overall revenue receipts and expenditure

(ii)   Deficit financing may be equal to borrowing from the banking system
of the country.

12.    (a)   Fiscal deficit - Excess of total expenditure over total receipts 
less
borrowings.


Budget deficit - Excess of total expenditure over total receipts.
Revenue deficit-Excess of total expenditure over revenue receipts.

Primary  deficit-Excess  of  total  expenditure  over  total  receipts  less
borrowings & Interest payments.

13.    (c)   Transfer   payment   is   a   payment   of   money   to   
individuals   by
government without taking any goods or service.

Examples :

•      Unemployment allowance

•      Social security payments

•      Old age pension

•      Student grant

•      Subsidies to farmers, exporters & manufacturer.

14.    (a)   A   Sinking   Fund   is   a   fund   created   by   the   
government   and
gradually  accumulated  every  year  by  setting  aside  a  part  of
current public revenue in such a way that it would be sufficient to
pay off the funded debt at the time of maturity. Under this method,
the aggregate burden of public debt is least felt, as the burden of
taxing  the  people  to  repay  the  debt  is  spread  evenly  over  the
period of the accumulation of the fund. The preferable alternative
for the government is to raise a new loan and credit the proceeds
of sinking fund. It is a separate fund established by a government.

15.    (b)   Deficit  Financing  is  an  expansionist  device  of  currency  
machine
and is accompanied by inflation and has many adverse effects on
the economy. It has also been compared to a drug market in red
‘Poison’ which is prescribed for a certain purpose and has to be
administered  in  small  regulated  dose.  When  the  outlay  of  a
government  exceeds  its  tax  revenues,  the  government  budget  is
said        to be in deficit; government spending in excess of tax receipts
is known as deficit spending. Governments usually issue bonds to
match their deficit.

16.    (b)   Effective  Revenue  Deficit  is  basically  revenue  deficit  
excluding
expenditure on capital generation form grants from the Centre to
the  states. It signifies the amount of capital receipts that are being
used for actual consumption expenditure of the Government. It is
a new term introduced in the Union Budget 2011-12. It has now
become a new fiscal parameter.


17.    (a)   The  Janta  Party  coalition  government  led  by  Morar  Ji  Desai
demonetized  the  currency  notes  of  Rs.  1,000,  Rs.  5,000  and  Rs.
10,000 on 16 January 1978 to curb counterfeit currency and black
money. The Finance Minister was Haribhai M. Patel at the time.

18.    (c)   Finance  Minister  Vishwanath  Pratap  Singh’s  Long  Term  Fiscal
Policy (LTFP) unveiled in January, 1986.

19.    (d)   In   recommending   horizontal   distribution,   the   14th   
Finance
Commission has used broad parameters of population (1971) and
changes  of  population  since,  income  distance,  forest  cover  and
area.

20.    (d)   Imposition  of  higher  duty  on  exports  is  not  likely  to  
help  in
improving India’s balance of payments position.

21.    (c)   The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  RBI  uses  the  monetary  policy  
to
manage  liquidity  or  money  supply  in  a  manner  that  balances
inflation and at the same time aids growth. The tools RBI uses to
manage monetary policy are :

1. Repo and Reverse Repo Rate.

2. Cash Reserve Ratio CRR.

3. Open Market Operations.

4. Statutory Liquidity Ratio.

5. Bank Rate.

22.    (b)   The  first  phase  of  liberalization  was  initiated  in  India  
under  the
regime  of  P.V.Narsimha  Rao  as  a  PM  and  Manmohan  Singh  as
Finance Minister in 1991.

23.    (a)   A regressive tax is generally a tax that is applied uniformly. This
means that it hits lower income individuals harder. Regressive tax
imposes a greater burden (relative to resources) on the poor than
on the rich — there is an inverse relationship between the tax rate
and   the   taxpayer’s   ability   to   pay   as   measured   by   assets,
consumption, or income.

24.    (a)   “Taxation  over  taxes”  or  “cascading-effect”  of  the  taxes  
adds  to
the  deadweight  loss  i.e.  slump  in  total  surplus  of  supply  chain
consisting  of  supplier,  manufacturer,  retailer  and  consumer.  Due
to cascading tax imposition leads to a disproportionate increase in
prices by an extent more than the rise in the tax.


25.    (c)   Fiscal   policy   is   the   use   of   government   revenue   
collection
(taxation)  and  expenditure  (spending)  to  influence  the  economy.
The two main instruments of fiscal policy are changes in the level
and composition of taxation and government spending in various
sectors.

26.    (b)   Fiscal drag is an economics term referring to a situation where a
government’s  net  fiscal  position  (equal  to  its  spending  less  any
taxation)  does  not  meet  the  net  savings  goals  of  the  private
economy.  Fiscal  drag  is  a  concept  where  inflation  and  earnings
growth may push more taxpayers into higher tax bracket.

27.    (a)   A  Pigovian  tax  is  applied  to  a  market  activity  that  is  
generating
negative  externalities  (costs  for  somebody  else)  like  cigarette
consumption, burning of fossil fuel.

28.    (d)   Basel III is basically a regulatory accord designed specifically 
for
the banking sector. It aims to improve the supervision, regulation
and   risk   management   within   the   sector.   It   also   targets   at
strengthening the transparency of the banks.

29.    (c)   A  progressive  tax  is  a  tax  in  which  the  tax  rate  
increases  as  the
taxable   base   amount   increases   Regarding   progressive   tax,
marginal tax rate should be increasing and it should be more than
average tax rate.

30.    (a)   The Goods and Services Tax GST is a Value Added Tax VAT
replacing  all  indirect  taxes  levied  on  goods  and  services  by  the
Indian Central and State governments. India is a federal republic,
and the GST is thus implemented concurrently by the central and
state   governments   as   the   Central   GST   and   the   State   GST
respectively. Exports will be zero-rated and imports will be levied
the  same  taxes  as  domestic  goods  and  services  adhering  to  the
destination principle.

31.    (d)   The Minimum Alternative Tax MAT was introduced for the first
time in the Budget for the year 1996-97. Minimum alternate tax or
MAT  is  a  tax  levied  on  firms/  companies  or  limited  liability
partnership LLPs making abundant profits as well as distributing
dividend to its shareholders who leveraging on the features of the
Indian    Taxation    system    do    not    contribute    towards    the
government’s taxation kitty. Thus, for such corporates a minimal


tax amounting to some fixed percentage of book profits i.e. profits
according to accounting records is charged as minimal alternative
tax MAT.

32.    (b)   Government  of  India  is  disinvesting  its  share  from  public  
sector
undertakings.  Most  of  government  undertakings  were  incurring
losses   during   the   pre   liberalization   period.   Hence,   after   the
introduction of new economic policy in 1991, government started
downsizing its share in PSU. But the process of disinvestment is
very slow due to host of legal and political hurdles.

33.    (a)   PHrPDnHnt  AFFRunt  NuPEHr  (PAN)FDrd  is  unique  alphanumeric
combination. It is issued by the Indian Income Tax Department. It
serves    as an important ID proof, date of birth proof and proof of
tax  payer.  However  it  can’t  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  address
proof, as address is not mentioned on PAN card.

34.    (d)   Agricultural  income  tax  to  states  in  India  is  assigned  by 
 the
Constitution  of  India.  The  agency  responsible  for  it  is  Finance
Commission  whose  function  is  distribution  of  net  proceeds  of
taxes  between  Centre  and  the  States,  to  be  divided  as  per  their
respective contributions to the taxes.

Finance  commission:  It  is  mainly  to  give  its  recommendation  on
distribution  of  tax  revenues  between  the  union  &  the  states  and
amongst the states themselves.

Interstate council : It is established to facilitate co-ordination of policies
and their implementation between the Union & the state govt.

IFC  :  It’s  main  objective  is  to  faster  a  measurable  increase  in  the
availability   of   agriculture   finance   in   IFC’s   client   portfolio

36.    (d)   Agricultural income tax is levied on the income from Agriculture.
At present agriculture is subjected to – two direct taxes and they
are Agricultural Income Tax and Land Tax. They are levied by the
state governments. Not all states levy agricultural income tax.

37.    (b)   The  Government  of  India  earns  maximum  revenue  from  Union
Excise  Duty  which  is  indirect  tax  levied  and  collected  on  the
goods manufactured in India and consumed within the country.
CXVWoP DXWy : It is a variation of Indirect tax and is applicable
on  all  goods  imported  and  a  few  Goods  exported  out  of  the
country.

CoUpoUDWion  WD[  :  It  is  a  direct  tax  imposed  by  jurisdiction  on  the
income or capital of Income.

38.    (a)   Laffer   curve   is   a   representation   of   the   relationship 
  between
possible rates of taxation and the resulting levels  of  government
revenue. It illustrates the concept of taxable income elasticity-i.e.,
taxable income will change in response to changes in the rate of
taxation.

PhiOOipV CXUYe a supposed inverse relationship between the level
of unemployment and the rate of inflation.

39.    (a)   Roughly  80%  comes  from  the  individual  income  tax  and  the
payroll taxes that fund social insurance programme. Another 11%
comes from corporate income tax and the rest is a form of a mix
course.

40.    (b)   Income  Tax  (1860);  Expenditure  Tax  (1956);  Value  Added  Tax
(1996-97) Fringe Benefits Tax (2005).

41.    (c)   A progressive tax receives a larger percentage from the income of
higher earners than it acts from low income person.

42.    (b)   Corporation tax in India is the major source of Gross Tax Revenue
(GTR)   for   the   Government   of   India.   It   provides   higher   tax
collection in comparison to income tax, custom duty and service
tax.

43.    (c)   The  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  under  Ministry  of
Finance   is   the   nodal   agency   of   the   Union   Government   to
formulate    and    monitor    country’s    economic    policies    and
programmes   having   a   bearing   on   domestic   and   international
aspects of economic management.


44.    (c)   The government influences private sector expenditure by taxation,
subsidies and macro-economic policies.

45.    (a)   Corporation Tax, Wealth Tax and Income Tax are in the category
of direct tax.

46.    (a)   The  sharp  decline  in  crude  oil  price  helped  the  
government  to
deregulate  the  price  of  diesel  and  thus  reduce  a  huge  burden  of
subsidy  on  the  exchequer.  India  if  not  a  producing  giant,  is
certainly a refining hub where it refines and markets around 220
metric  million  tonnes  of  petroleum  products.  Out  of  this  around
160 mmt is used for domestic consumption while the rest is used
for exports. Therefore, the drop in price of oil will be a blessing
for the Indian refineries and the oil marketing companies.

47.    (b)   Corporation Tax is imposed by Central Government.

48.    (d)   Generally,  the  income  of  a  company  falls  under  any  of  the
following 4 heads of income:

(1)   Profits or gains from the business

(2)   Income from property, whether it is housing, commercial, self-occupied
or let-out. If the property is used in the company’s business
operations, it does not fall under this head.

(3)   Capital gains

(4)   Income from other sources including winnings from lotteries, races and
interest on securities.

49.    (d)   Motor  Vehicle  tax  is  not  a  source  of  tax  revenue  for  
the  Central
Government in India. It is type of revenue part of State tax.

50.    (b)   KK Surcharge is the additional percentage of tax which domestic
tax  players  need  to  pay  when  declaring  undisclosed  income  by
paying tax at 30%. The KKS above the tax is 7.5%.

51.    (b)   Suggestion for the imposition of expenditure tax in India for the
first time was given by Kaldor on 1956.

52.    (b)   MODVAT e.g. modified value added tax is related to Value added
tax e.g. VAT.

53.    (d)   Toll   Taxes   is   one   the   main   Sources   of   revenue   
for   State
Governments. It is not levied by Govt. of India.

54.    (d)   The  Income  Tax  department  has  launched  a  special  electronic
grievance redressal system called ‘e–nivaran’ in order to fast track


taxpayer    grievances    and    ensure    early    resolution    of    their
complaints.

55.    (a)   As per union budget 2016-17, the share of taxes in one rupee.
Corporation tax              :                   19 Paise

Income tax                     :                   14 Paise

Service tax                     :                   9 Paise

Union Excise Duty        :                   12 Paise

56.    (c)   The  price-elasticity  of  demand  for  a  good  also  depends  on 
 the
proportion   of   their   income   the   buyers   spend   on   the   good.
Therefore,  if  the  sales  tax  on  a  commodity  is  raised,  but  the
revenue   earned   through   its   sale   decrease   sharply,   the   price
elasticity of demand for the commodity would be high.

57.    (a)   Customs duties-Export duty and import duty are levied by Central
Government.

58.    (a)   As  mention  in  article  268  of  Indian  Constitution,  Stamp  
Duties
are   mentioned   in   the   Union   List   shall   be   levied   by   the
Government of India but collected and appropriated by the States.

59.    (a)   Exports will become ZERO RATED under GST, so statements 2
and  3  would  have  been  correct  If  examiner  had  used  moderate
words “GST will help”. But he has used ‘extreme’ words. GST is
unlikely to ‘drastically’ reduce CAD Because of crude oil import
and  OPEC  cartel  that  manipulates  its  prices.  Similarly,  GST  is
unlikely   to   enormously   increase   size   of   oureconomy   (IMF
projection   ~1-1.5%   addition   in   growth   rate.   and   we   can’t
overtake  China  in  near  future,  because  unlike  China  we  are
keeping our currency undervalued against dollar. Hence statement
2 and 3 are wrong. We are left with Answer A.

60.    (b)   Act  provides  is  an  appellate  tribunal,  and  they’re  
required  to
finish case within one year. So #3 is wrong, by elimination, we are
left  with  A  and  B.  So,  B  is  most  appropriate  because  IT  dept
(=therefore Government) can seize the benami properties.

61.    (d)   From  the  official  Economic  Survey  2014-15,  we  get  following
data If we go only by the strict interpretation of above graph then
answer should be “D”


62.    (b)   The responsibility for coinage lies with central government on the
basis  of  the  Coinage  Act,  1906.  The  designing  and  minting  of
coins in various denominations is decided by Central government.
Except one rupee note & coin all the currencies are minted by RBI. In
one rupee note, RIB signature of RBI Governor of currency held

in 4 places-

Hydrabad, Mumbai, Kolkata & Noida.

63.    (d)   Devaluation leads to a country’s exports to become less expensive
as the currency is deliberately adjusted down to other currencies,
making imports more expensive, making domestic consumers less
likely   to   purchase   them   thus   the   domestic   companies   are
encouraged to substitute imports.

64.    (d)   All  the  above  given  terms  are  not  a  financial  term.  RTGS 
 (Real
Time  Gross  Settlement)  is  fund  transfer  system,  core  banking
solutions   like   treasury   and   investment   are   all   processes   not
financial term.

65.    (d)   Money  laundering  occurs  in  three  steps:  the  first  step  
involves
introducing cash into the financial system by some means called
as placement; the second involves carrying out complex financial
transactions to camouflage the illegal source called layering; and
the     final   step   entails   acquiring   wealth   generated   from   the
transactions of the illicit funds called as integration.

Money LDXndeUing   It is the process of transforing the profits of
crime and corruption into obstensibliy Legitimate assets.

66.    (c)   India   switched   over   to   decimal   currency   in   1957   
with   the
amendment  of  the  Indian  Coinage  Act.  The  rupee  remained
unchanged  in  value  and  nomenclature.  It,  however,  was  now
divided into 100 ‘Paisa’ instead of 16 Annas.

67.    (b)   In 1991, India faced a serious balance of payment crisis and was
forced to sharply devalue its currency. The country was in the grip
of  high  inflation,  low  growth  and  the  foreign  reserves  were  not
even worth to meet three weeks of imports.

Under  these  situations,  the  currency  was  devalued  to  17.90  against  a
dollar.

In July of 1991 the Indian Government devalued the rupees by between
18 and 19%. The Government also changed its trade policy higher


restrictive to a system of tradable EXIM SCRIPS.

68.    (a)   The one rupee note is issued by Ministry of Finance and it bears
the  signature  of  Finance  Secretary,  while  other  notes  bear  the
signature of Governor RBI. However, only RBI is the only source
of legal tender money because distribution of one rupee notes and
coins  and  small  coins  all  over  the  country  is  undertaken  by  the
Reserve Bank as agent of the Government.

69.    (d)   The rise in interest rates results in increasing cost of borrowing 
so
lending decreases because businesses do not borrow at high cost.
Moreover it results in increase in cost of production as the cost for
all  suppliers  of  raw  material  increases  due  to  increase  in  their
borrowing cost. For individuals the savings increase as they start
saving in lieu for higher return as interest. Higher rates of interest
result  in  decrease  in  return  on  capital  as  cost  of  investment  in
capital increases.

70.    (a)   Higher interest rates in low inflation means higher real returns 
not
just  on  money,  but  on  all  other  assets  too.  These  higher  real
returns increases the allocation of investment by people.

71.    (b)

72.    (a)

73.    (b)

74.    (b)   Indira Vikas Patra was a small scale deposit scheme operated by
the  post  offices  all  over  the  country  to  encourage  the  idea  of
investment  in  the  minds  of  the  lower-middle  class  people.  NSC,
National Saving Scheme and PPF all grant tax rebate.

75.    (c)   A reserve currency (or anchor currency) is a currency that is held
in significant quantities by governments and institutions as part of
their  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and  that  is  commonly  used  in
international   transactions   for   commodities   like   oil   and   gold.
Persons who live in a country that issues a reserve currency can
purchase  imports  and  borrow  across  borders  more  cheaply  than
persons  in  other  nations  because  they  need  not  exchange  their
currency to do so.

76.    (c)   At present, index is being developed only for residential housing
sector. However, at a later stage, the index could be expanded to
develop   separate   indices   for   commercial   property   and   land.


Primary data on housing prices is being collected from real estate
agents      by      commissioning      the      services      of      private
consultancy/research organisations of national repute. In addition,
data                                 on  housing  prices  is  also  being  
collected  from  the  housing
finance  companies  and  banks,  which  is  based  on  housing  loans
contracted by these institutions.

77.    (c)   Financial   inclusion   or   inclusive   financing   is   the   
delivery   of
financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged
and  low-income  segments  of  society.  For  financial  inclusion
‘Know  your  customer’  (K<C)  norms  should  be  relaxed  and  no
frills  account  should  be  opened  for  low  income  segments  which
are  looking  for  basic  banking  only.  Along  with  general  purpose
credit cards should be issued and bank branches should be opened
in unbanked rural areas.

78.    (c)   Devaluation is a deliberate downward adjustment to the value of a
country’s   currency,   relative   to   another   currency,   group   of
currencies. Since it is relative to other currency so internal price
remains unchanged. It causes a country’s exports to become less
expensive and imports more expensive.

79.    (d)   A liquidity trap is a situation in which injections of cash into 
the
private  banking  system  by  a  central  bank  fail  to  lower  interest
rates and hence fail to stimulate economic growth. A liquidity trap
is caused when people hoard cash because they expect interest to
rise  in  future  ,an  adverse  event  such  as  deflation,  insufficient
aggregate demand, or war.

80.    (d)   Currency notes and coins are called fiat money. They don’t have
intrinsic  value  like  a  gold  or  silver  coin.  The  currency-deposit
ratio measures the relationship between the cash people have on
hand and what they have in their accounts.

81.    (b)   By buying the government securities from the banks and reducing
SLR  may  inject  money  into  the  system.  However  Raising  cash
Reserve  Ratio  may  take  away  liquidity  from  the  market  as  the
banks   will   have   to   deposit   more   money   with   the   RBI   and
similarly entering the reverse repo operations may also take away
liquidity from the market.


82.    (a)   Micro-credit  extended  by  banks  to  individuals  is  reckoned  
as  a
part  of  their  priority  sector  lending  and  no  particular  model  has
been prescribed for micro-finance and banks have been extended
freedom to formulate their own models.

83.    (a)   Devaluation happens in countries with a fixed exchange rate. In a
fixed-rate  economy,  the  government  decides  what  its  currency
should  be  worth  compared  with  that  of  other  countries.  The
exchange  rate  can  change  only  when  the  government  decides  to
change  it.  If  a  government  decides  to  make  its  currency  less
valuable, the change is called devaluation. Depreciation happens
in  countries  with  a  floating  exchange  rate.  A  floating  exchange
rate means that the global investment market determines the value
of a country’s currency.

84.    (a)   Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) is the rate at which scheduled
banks  could  borrow  funds  overnight  from  the  Reserve  Bank  of
India  (RBI)  against  approved  government  securities.  Banks  can
borrow    funds    through    MSF    during    acute    cash    shortage
(considerable   shortfall   of   liquidity).   This   measure   has   been
introduced by RBI to regulate short-term asset liability mismatch
more  effectively  and  the  borrowing  is  within  Statutory  liquidity
requirements.  The  Marginal  Standing  Facility  (MSF)  is  pegged
100bps     or 1 % above the Repo Rate.

85.    (d)   Basel III is basically a regulatory accord designed specifically 
for
the banking sector. It aims to improve the supervision, regulation
and   risk   management   within   the   sector.   It   also   targets   at
strengthening the transparency of the banks.

86.    (b)   Financial   inclusion   is   the   delivery   of   financial   
services,   at
affordable  costs,  to  sections  of  disadvantaged  and  low  income
segments   of   society.It   includes   opening   educational   centres,
opening   wealth   management   centres   by   Citibank   etc.   Khan
commission had put forward its report on financial inclusion.

87.    (c)   %DViV  poinWV:  It  is  the  increase  in  interest  rates  in  
percentage
terms.

—    5epo UDWe: Repo rate is the policy rate and is part of RBI’s Liquidity
Adjustment  Facility  (LAF).  It  is  the  rate  at  which  commercial


banks borrow from the RBI by selling their securities or financial
assets to the RBI for a short-period of time.

—    5eYeUVe Uepo UDWe: Reverse Repo Rate is also a part of LAF. It is the
rate  of  interest  at  which  the  central  bank  borrows  funds  from
commercial banks for a short duration.

—    CDVh UeVeUYe UDWio: CRR is the minimum percentage of cash deposits
that banks must keep with the central bank.

88.    (c)   NABARD  doesn’t  give  “direct”  credit  assistance.  It  provides
credit  via  intermediaries  such  as  micro  finance  companies,  co-
operative society, RRB. Therefore, 2 is false.

89.    (b)   Open  market  operation:  When  RBI  buys/sells  securities  in  
open
market,   in   case   of   OMO,   first   party   permanently   sells   the
Government security to second party. Second party is free to do
whatever it wants with that security.

90.    (c)   It  will  remain  the  same,  because  banks  do  not  increase  
the
national income. So it remains the same immaterial whether banks
are there or not.

91.    (d)   Currency is most liquid, because you can use it as and when you
want. Time deposit with bank (e.g. fixed deposit), are least liquid
compared to savings/demand deposit with banks and currency.

92.    (b)   Because  Reserve  requirements  are  designed  as  “precautionary
measures” and not to stop banks from “excessive” profit.

93.    (c)   Through  assistance  of  Swiss  agency  for  Development  &  co-
operation,  NABARD  setup  the  Rural  innovation  fund.  RIDF  is
another noted scheme for the bank for rural development. Under
the   RIDF   scheme   ` 51,283   crore   have   been   sanctioned   for
2,44,651  projects  covering  irrigation,  rural  roads  and  bridges,
health & education, soil conservation, water schemes etc.

94.    (d)   The  head  office  of  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  
Rural
Development (NABARD) is located in Mumbai. It helps farmers
access timely and adequate credit.

95.    (d)   These  all  provide  finance  under  various  schemes  run  by  
central
government  and  state  governments  to  purchase  seeds,  fertilizer,
pesticides etc.


96.    (c)   It  was  established  on  12  July,  1982  in  sixth  five  year  
plan  by  a
special act by the parliament and its main focus was to uplift rural
India by increasing the credit flow for elevation of agriculture &
rural non farm sector.

97.    (a)   In   India,   commercial   banks   have   the   highest   share   
in   the
disbursement  of  credit  to  agriculture  and  allied  activities.  The
commercial   banks   disburse   around   60%   credit   followed   by
cooperative banks around 30% .

98.    (a)   Cooperative  Banks  operate  on  no  profit  no  loss  basis,  and 
 they
operate in all sectors including agriculture sector. NABARD is not
a  Cooperative  Bank.  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural
Development (NABARD) is an apex development bank in India.

99.    (c)   National    Bank    for    Agriculture    and    Rural    
Development
(NABARD)   is   an   apex   development   bank   in   India.   It   was
established on 12 July, 1982 in sixth five year plan and its main
focus  was  to  uplift  rural  India  by  increasing  the  credit  flow  for
elevation  of  agriculture  and  rural  non-farm  sector  and  laying
down   policies   and   to   oversee   the   operations   of   the   RRBs.
Moreover Regional Rural Banks grant direct loans and advances
to  marginal  farmers  and  rural  artisans.  So  both  statements  are
correct.

100.  (b)   In   India,   ‘Report   on   Currency   and   Finance’   is   the   
annual

117.  (b)   The Cash Reserve Ratio is the amount of funds that the banks are
bound to keep with Reserve bank of India as a portion of their Net
Demand  and  Time  Liabilities  (NDTL).  When  RBI  increases  the
CRR,  less  funds  are  available  with  banks  as  they  have  to  keep
larger  portions  of  their  cash  in  hand  with  RBI.  This  means  that
